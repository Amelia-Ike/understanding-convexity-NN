# "Understanding Convexity of Representations" 

This project is a cutting-edge exploration in the field of AI, focusing on how deep neural networks conceptualize and process information. 
This project delves into the hypothesis that neural networks, akin to human brains, encode "natural concepts" in a convex manner. This means that these concepts are represented in a way where any point within the concept's range can be reached through a straight line without leaving the concept's boundary.

The project aims to investigate the extent to which the representations formed by neural networks for various concepts adhere to this principle of convexity. It involves applying advanced techniques to analyze the conceptual representations within these networks, going beyond traditional class predictions to explore the underlying structure and organization of learned concepts.

By probing the convexity of these representations, this research seeks to gain insights into the fundamental workings of AI models, potentially leading to advancements in how these models are designed and how they mimic cognitive processes. This exploration is not only academically intriguing but also carries significant implications for the development of more intuitive and efficient AI systems.
